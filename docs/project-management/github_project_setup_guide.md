## Part 1 — Create the GitHub Repository

### Step 1.1 — Create Repository

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → sign in
2. Click **+** (top right) → **New repository**
3. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `project-intelligent`
   - **Description:** `India-first NSE/BSE swing trade signal platform powered by ML`
   - **Visibility:** `Private` (your personal trading data — keep it private)
   - **Initialize repository:** ✅ (tick this)
   - **Add a README:** ✅
   - **Add .gitignore:** choose `Python`
   - **License:** None (personal project)
4. Click **Create repository**

### Step 1.2 — Clone to Local Machine

Open PowerShell in your workspace folder:

```powershell
cd C:\Manivannan\Workspace\ANTIGRAVITY\STOCKS
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/project-intelligent.git PROJECT_INTELLIGENT_GIT
```

> **Note:** The existing `PROJECT_INTELLIGENT` folder has your architecture docs. In Step 3.2 we will push those docs into this new repo.

### Step 1.3 — Initialize the Existing Folder as a Git Repo

If you prefer to work directly in the existing folder:

```powershell
cd C:\Manivannan\Workspace\ANTIGRAVITY\STOCKS\PROJECT_INTELLIGENT
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/project-intelligent.git
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit — architecture docs and PRD"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Part 2 — Set Up GitHub Labels

Labels are the backbone of the entire hierarchy. Create all labels before creating any issue.

### Step 2.1 — Open Label Manager

Go to your repo → **Issues** → **Labels** → **New label**

### Step 2.2 — Complete Label Set

Create every label below. Colors are chosen to visually separate label categories at a glance.

#### Type Labels (what kind of item is this?)

| Label Name | Color | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `type:feature` | `#0052CC` (dark blue) | Parent epic — groups stories |
| `type:story` | `#0075CA` (medium blue) | User story — groups tasks |
| `type:task` | `#BFD4F2` (light blue) | Smallest unit of work |
| `type:bug` | `#D73A4A` (red) | Defect found during testing |
| `type:spike` | `#E4E669` (yellow) | Research / investigation |
| `type:doc` | `#EDEDED` (grey) | Documentation only |
| `type:infra` | `#006B75` (teal) | AWS / environment setup |

#### Phase Labels (which phase does this belong to?)

| Label Name | Color | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `phase:0-setup` | `#F9D0C4` (light pink) | Architecture, PRD, environment provisioning |
| `phase:1-core` | `#FBCA04` (yellow) | Core pipeline implementation (all jobs) |
| `phase:2-enhance` | `#0E8A16` (green) | Phase 2 enhancements (FII/DII, BSE, etc.) |

#### Component Labels (which part of the system?)

| Label Name | Color | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `comp:ingestion` | `#B60205` (dark red) | J01-J03 — data ingestion |
| `comp:feature-eng` | `#D93F0B` (orange) | J04 — feature engineering |
| `comp:ml-pipeline` | `#E99695` (salmon) | J06 — model training |
| `comp:inference` | `#F9D0C4` (peach) | J07-J08 — prediction + signals |
| `comp:universe` | `#5319E7` (purple) | J01 — universe selection + scanner |
| `comp:monitoring` | `#1D76DB` (blue) | J09 — observability + alerts |

| `comp:docs` | `#EDEDED` (grey) | Architecture docs, PRD, ADRs |

#### Priority Labels

| Label Name | Color | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `priority:critical` | `#B60205` (dark red) | Blocks all other work |
| `priority:high` | `#D93F0B` (orange) | Must complete this milestone |
| `priority:medium` | `#FBCA04` (yellow) | Should complete this milestone |
| `priority:low` | `#C2E0C6` (light green) | Nice to have |

#### State Labels (special conditions)

| Label Name | Color | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `blocked` | `#B60205` (dark red) | Cannot proceed — waiting on something |
| `needs-review` | `#FBCA04` (yellow) | Needs platform owner decision |
| `deferred` | `#EDEDED` (grey) | Explicitly moved to a later phase |
| `wontfix` | `#EDEDED` (grey) | Decided not to implement |

> **Tip:** Use `<hex-color>` in the color field when creating labels. GitHub accepts hex codes directly.

## Part 3 — Set Up GitHub Milestones

Milestones are your time-boxed phases. Every issue belongs to exactly one milestone.

### Step 3.1 — Open Milestone Manager

Go to your repo → **Issues** → **Milestones** → **New milestone**

### Step 3.2 — Create All Milestones

| Milestone ID | Title | Purpose | Due Date Suggestion |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | `Phase 0 — Architecture & Sign-Off` | Close architecture phase, PRD sign-off, Phase 0 gate | 2026-05-15 |
| M1 | `Phase 1.1 — Environment Provisioning` | AWS infra, GitHub repo, PostgreSQL schema, secrets | 2026-05-31 |
| M2 | `Phase 1.2 — Data Ingestion Layer` | J01 + J03 — OHLCV, fundamentals, delivery %, macro | 2026-06-30 |
| M3 | `Phase 1.3 — Feature Engineering Layer` | J04 — all 10 feature groups in Gold layer | 2026-07-31 |
| M4 | `Phase 1.4 — ML Training Pipeline` | J06 — model training, walk-forward validation, promotion gate | 2026-08-31 |
| M5 | `Phase 1.5 — Inference & Signal Generation` | J07 + J08 — predictions, serving gates, trade signals | 2026-09-30 |
| M6 | `Phase 1.6 — Monitoring & Operations` | J09 — CloudWatch, SNS alerts, audit trail, daily ops routine | 2026-10-31 |
| M7 | `Phase 1.7 — Acceptance Testing & Go-Live` | End-to-end validation, Definition of Done checklist | 2026-11-30 |

> **How to fill in a milestone:**
> - Title: exactly as shown above
> - Description: one sentence of purpose
> - Due date: your target date — can be adjusted any time

---

## Part 4 — Set Up GitHub Projects (Board)

GitHub Projects (v2) is your JIRA board. It gives you kanban, table view, custom fields, and filters.

### Step 4.1 — Create a Project

1. Go to your GitHub profile → **Projects** tab → **New project**
2. Choose **Board** template (kanban view)
3. Name: `PROJECT INTELLIGENT`
4. Click **Create project**

### Step 4.2 — Set Up Board Columns (Status)

Delete any default columns and create exactly these 6:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `📋 Backlog` | Created but not scheduled for current milestone |
| `🔜 Ready` | Scheduled, all dependencies met, ready to start |
| `🔧 In Progress` | Actively being worked on |
| `👀 In Review` | Done — needs platform owner review or testing |
| `✅ Done` | Fully complete, acceptance criteria met |
| `🚫 Blocked` | Cannot progress — dependency or decision needed |

### Step 4.3 — Add Custom Fields

In the Project view → **+ field** (top right of table view) → add these fields:

| Field Name | Field Type | Values |
|---|---|---|
| `Phase` | Single select | Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2 |
| `Component` | Single select | Ingestion, Feature-Eng, ML-Pipeline, Inference, Universe, Monitoring, Infra, Data-Store, Docs |
| `Priority` | Single select | Critical, High, Medium, Low |
| `Milestone` | (auto — linked to GitHub Milestone) | — |
| `Story Points` | Number | Effort estimate (optional) |
| `Job` | Single select | J01, J02, J03, J04, J05, J06, J07, J08, J09, N/A |

### Step 4.4 — Link Your Repository to the Project

Inside the Project → **Settings** (⚙️) → **Linked repositories** → **Add repository** → select `project-intelligent`

## Part 5 — Issue Structure and Templates

### Step 5.1 — How Issues Link to Each Other

GitHub has no native parent-child hierarchy in free accounts. Use this convention in every issue body:

**In a Feature issue body:**
```markdown
## Child Stories
- [ ] #<story-issue-number> — Story title
- [ ] #<story-issue-number> — Story title
```

**In a Story issue body:**
```markdown
## Parent Feature
Part of #<feature-issue-number>

## Child Tasks
- [ ] #<task-issue-number> — Task title
- [ ] #<task-issue-number> — Task title
```

**In a Task issue body:**
```markdown
## Parent Story
Part of #<story-issue-number>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] criterion 1
- [ ] criterion 2
```

When you reference `#123` in an issue body, GitHub auto-links and shows it in the referenced issue's timeline. This gives you bidirectional traceability.

### Step 5.2 — Create Issue Templates

Create three issue templates so every new issue is consistent.

Create the folder `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` in your repo and add three files:

#### File 1: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md`
```markdown
---
name: Feature
about: A feature (epic) that groups related stories
title: "[FEATURE] "
labels: type:feature
assignees: ''
---

## Description
<!-- What is this feature and why does it exist? Map to PRD FR-XX. -->

## PRD Reference
FR-XX

## Child Stories
<!-- List stories that belong to this feature. Update as issues are created. -->
- [ ] #<!-- issue number --> — story title

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All child stories are closed
- [ ] Feature is tested end-to-end

## Notes
<!-- Architecture doc references, ADRs, design decisions -->
```

#### File 2: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/story.md`
```markdown
---
name: Story
about: A user story — a slice of a feature
title: "[STORY] "
labels: type:story
assignees: ''
---

## User Story
As a platform owner, I need _____ so that _____.

## Parent Feature
Part of #<!-- feature issue number -->

## Child Tasks
<!-- List tasks that implement this story. Update as issues are created. -->
- [ ] #<!-- issue number --> — task title

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] criterion 1
- [ ] criterion 2

## Notes
<!-- Links to architecture docs, schema references, config file names -->
```

#### File 3: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md`
```markdown
---
name: Task
about: A concrete implementation task linked to a story
title: "[TASK] "
labels: type:task
assignees: ''
---

## What needs to be done
<!-- Clear, specific implementation description -->

## Parent Story
Part of #<!-- story issue number -->

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] criterion 1
- [ ] criterion 2
- [ ] unit test passes
- [ ] no errors in CloudWatch / local log

## Files Affected
<!-- List the source files, configs, or docs this task will create or modify -->

## Notes
```

## Part 7 — Day-to-Day Workflow

Once everything is set up, this is how you work every day:

### Creating a New Issue

1. Go to your repo → **Issues** → **New issue**
2. Pick the correct template (Feature / Story / Task)
3. Fill in: title, description, acceptance criteria
4. Set: **Labels** (type + phase + comp + priority), **Milestone**, **Assignee** (yourself)
5. Add to **GitHub Project** (drag to `📋 Backlog`)

### Starting Work on a Task

1. Move the issue card from `📋 Backlog` → `🔜 Ready` → `🔧 In Progress`
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b task/<issue-number>-short-description`
3. Commit with reference: `git commit -m "feat: implement yfinance OHLCV fetcher closes #42"`
4. Push and open a Pull Request linking `Closes #42` in the PR body

### Closing a Task

1. Merge the PR — GitHub auto-closes the linked issue
2. Move parent Story: check off the task in the Story's body `- [x] #42`
3. When all child tasks are closed, close the Story
4. When all child Stories are closed, close the Feature

### Sunday Review Ritual (30 min)

1. Open GitHub Project board
2. Filter by `🚫 Blocked` — resolve blockers or update notes
3. Filter by `👀 In Review` — approve or request changes
4. Plan next 3-5 tasks for the week — move from Backlog to Ready
5. Update any issue notes from your scanner/ops review findings

## Part 8 — Recommended Creation Order

Create issues in this exact order to ensure parent links are valid when you create child issues:

```
Step 1: Create all FEATURE issues (FEATURE-001 to FEATURE-021) → note their numbers
Step 2: Create all STORY issues → add parent feature link #<number>
Step 3: Create TASK issues as you start each Story → add parent story link
```

Do not create all tasks upfront. Create Tasks for the next 1-2 Stories only — requirements often evolve.

## Part 9 — Story/Task Workflow (4-Tier Hierarchy)

### 4-Tier Hierarchy Overview

```
Epic
 └── Feature
      └── Story
           └── Task
```

| Tier    | GitHub Issue Type | Naming Convention          | Example                          |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Epic    | Issue             | `[EPIC-NNN] Title`         | `[EPIC-001] Project Setup`       |
| Feature | Issue             | `[FEATURE-NNN] Title`      | `[FEATURE-002] Env Provisioning` |
| Story   | Issue             | `[STORY] Title`            | `[STORY] Reproducible Dev Env`   |
| Task    | Issue             | `[TASK] Title`             | `[TASK] Create requirements.txt` |

### How to Create a New Story

1. Go to your **project-intelligent** repo → **Issues** → **New issue**
2. Select the **Story** issue template
3. Fill in:
   - **Title:** `[STORY] <short description>`
   - **Labels:** `type:story`, phase label, component label
   - **Milestone:** Select the appropriate milestone (e.g., `M0`)
   - **Project:** Assign to your GitHub Project board
4. In the body, fill in the parent Feature reference:
   ```
   Part of #<feature-issue-number>
   ```
5. Submit the issue

Using `gh` CLI:
```sh
gh issue create -R biteberry/project-intelligent \
  --title "[STORY] Your story title" \
  --label "type:story,phase:p0,comp:infra" \
  --milestone "M0" \
  --body "## Summary\nDescribe the story.\n\n## Parent Feature\nPart of #<feature-number>"
```

### How to Link Stories as Sub-Issues of Features

GitHub does not have native parent-child issue linking via CLI yet, but you can:

**Option A — Body reference (recommended):**  
Add the following line in the Story body:
```
Part of #<feature-issue-number>
```

**Option B — Use the Sub-issues UI (GitHub Projects):**
1. Open the Feature issue
2. Scroll to the **Sub-issues** section (right sidebar)
3. Click **Add sub-issue** → search and select the Story issue

**Option C — gh CLI (tasklist markdown):**
```sh
gh issue edit <feature-issue-number> -R biteberry/project-intelligent \
  --body-file updated_body.md
```
Where `updated_body.md` includes a tasklist:
```markdown
## Stories
- [ ] #<story-issue-number>
```

---

### How to Create Tasks and Link to Stories

1. Go to **Issues** → **New issue** → select the **Task** template
2. Fill in:
   - **Title:** `[TASK] <short description>`
   - **Labels:** `type:task`, phase label, component label
   - **Milestone:** Same milestone as the parent Story
   - **Project:** Assign to your GitHub Project board
3. In the body, add the parent Story reference:
   ```
   Part of #<story-issue-number>
   ```

Using `gh` CLI:
```sh
gh issue create -R biteberry/project-intelligent \
  --title "[TASK] Your task title" \
  --label "type:task,phase:p0,comp:infra" \
  --milestone "M0" \
  --body "## What needs to be done\nDescribe the task.\n\n## Parent Story\nPart of #<story-issue-number>"
```

---

### Branch Naming Convention

When implementing a Task or Story, create a branch in your code repo:

```
story/<issue-number>-short-description
task/<issue-number>-short-description
```

Examples:
```
story/29-reproducible-dev-env
task/38-create-requirements-txt
```

---

### Linking a PR to the Project Board

When creating a pull request in your **code repo** (e.g., `biteberry/stock-intelligent`), reference the tracking issue in the PR description to link it to the project board:

```markdown
Closes biteberry/project-intelligent#<issue-number>
```

This will:
- Link the PR to the issue in your project board under **Linked pull requests**
- Automatically close the issue when the PR is merged (if using `Closes`)
